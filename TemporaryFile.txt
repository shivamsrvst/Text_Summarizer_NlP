This famous Akbar Birbal story has many versions too.It happened once that there was a theft in one of the citizens of the kingdom ruled by the emperor Akbar. They rushed to the king to help them find the thief and do justice for them. 
Birbal summoned all the thieves in the kingdom and handed them over sticks of equal size. He said, “These sticks are magical, they will grow by one inch more by tomorrow sunrise, when they are with the actual thief. So, you all bring these sticks tomorrow to the court and show to us.”
They all left for their homes. But the actual thief could not sleep at all. He was scared where the stick would grow in size and get him caught by the king. Looking at his agony, the thief’s wife suggested, “why don’t you break the stick by two inches? So that by tomorrow it will be normal in length!!”
The thief was more than happy to listen to this advice. He immediately cut the stick carefully by two inches. He wrapped it in a cloth and slept peacefully. The next day, he took the stick along with the wrapped cloth to the court. When Birbal asked all the thieves to show their sticks, everyone showed theirs to the public. The actual thief also did it.
To his surprise, the stick did not grow! It was shorter by two inches than it was yesterday when Birbal gave it to him. Then Birbal identified that he is the thief and handed them to the soldiers. He said, “Maharajah, his guilty consciousness only got him caught!!”
Moral of this Akbar Birbal story: Guilty consciousness will never let you stay in peace. Any one who does bad things will get caught some day for sure, though it might appear that they escaped for time being.
